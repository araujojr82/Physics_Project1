1. Add "Virtual Walls" Left, Right, Up and Down (-X, X, -Z, Z)
2. Add Random Velocity to the balls (for test the collision only)
 2.1 Add "dragging" constant to slow down/until stop the balls.
3. Add Colision Sphere-Sphere response (Change colour)
4. Change Colision Sphere-Sphere response (Change direction)
5. Add Control to White ball:
 5.1 Left/Right arrows for direction/angle, Print Angle to console
 5.2 Up/Down arrows for velocity, Print Velocity to console
 5.3 Spacebar to "shoot"
6. Add Collision Sphere-Triangle(Change sphere colour)
7. Change Colision Sphere-Triangle response (Change sphere direction)
7. Add arrow to "display" the angle and velocity (waiting for Feeney's code)
8. Add cue stick (attached to white ball, position is the inverse of the arrow)
