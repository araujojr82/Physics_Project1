DONE 1. Add "Virtual Walls" Left, Right, Up and Down (-X, X, -Z, Z)
DONE 2. Add Random Velocity to the balls (for test the collision only)
DONE 2.1 Add "friction" constant to slow down/until stop the balls.
DONE 3. Add Colision Sphere-Sphere response (Change colour)
DONE 4. Add Colision Sphere-Sphere response(Change direction)
5. Add Control to White ball:
 5.1 Left/Right arrows for direction/angle, Print Angle to console
 5.2 Up/Down arrows for velocity, Print Velocity to console
DONE 5.3 Spacebar to "shoot"
6. Add Collision Sphere-Triangle(Change sphere colour)
7. Change Colision Sphere-Triangle response (Change sphere direction)
7. Add arrow to "display" the angle and velocity (waiting for Feeney's code)
DONE 8. Add cue stick (attached to white ball)
 8.1 Cue stick position is the inverse of the angle/velocity arrow)
9. Change the table model, to add holes in the sides
10. Add Multiple cameras options (1 centered at the white ball)
